## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/StreamVision-Oracle.git
   cd StreamVision-Oracle
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure environment variables:

Copy example.env → .env

Update with your Oracle DB credentials and configuration.

▶️ Usage
Run the main application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
The script will start capturing the live stream.

AI/ML models analyze the feed in real time.

Results are stored in Oracle DB for persistence and analysis.
